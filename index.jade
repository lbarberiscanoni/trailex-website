                        |  , originally from Mexico, moved to South Carolina while in high school. Jesus and Lorenzo met while representing South Carolina at the national conference for Youth in Government, and they instantly connected through they shared love of math and programming and more importantly through their shared belief in the American Dream. A programming prodigy since elementary school, Jesus has applied his talent in all of his many interests, ranging from robotics to economics. When he is not changing the world through his code, Jesus spends his time taking online college courses and running cross country.
